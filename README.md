Travel To Abroad:
Problem Statement/Opportunity:
Expand Worldview and Perspective
Traveling offers students to experience so many new things from food to languages to religions, that their worldview will be expanded. Having a greater perspective of the world sets students up for success because they will be open to differences in their own community when they co

me back to their ‘normal’ life. Having an expanded worldview allows students to be more inclusive and accepting of others that are different from them. 

Get out of your comfort zone
One major benefit of international travel for students is that it forces them to get out of their comfort zone. Since traveling allows you to experience so many new things, it will force you to open yourself up to experience new things. 

Although this may feel terrifying to leave your comfort zone, it is also where the most growth comes from. Outside of your comfort zone is where mistakes are made, lessons are learned and students become impactful members of society. 

Inspires creativity
Experiencing new things sparks new ideas. Travel is the best way of learning new things and adding to your repertoire. When you get to add new ideas and experiences to your repertoire, that may enable you to also become more creative. Creativity is a great way to portray the cultures you experienced and pay tribute to different cultures around the world.
